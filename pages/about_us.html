<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>
	We make cinematic-style videos for short films, and fun commercials for small, local businesses. We also help you bring your video ideas to life.
	Furthermore, we do photoshoots for events and products. We like to help you make your photos as easily accessible as possible and can even provide printing services from other local companies.
	We are famous for providing our 3D printing services, a rare and difficult printing service to find, especially in Winter Haven, Florida. 
	Not only that, but we’re a very community-based company that likes to give back to the community when we can and look out for our family.
</p>

<p>
	Winter Haven is a small city in central Florida south of Orlando and East of Tampa. It is home to Legoland Florida Resort, formerly known as Cyprus Gardens. It’s also the Water Ski Capital of the World, so we take pride in being privileged to capture amazing videos of our famous water skiers.

<h2> 
The History of Home Production Studios 
</h2> 

    <div id="containerAU">
        <div class="p1"><p> Home Production Studios was started by Dominic Redinbo, a young man with many bright ideas who needed access to a community and team to make them possible. So, after years of making simple stop-motion videos at home in his bedroom and writing stories for different unproduced films, he started working on a club. He began planning this club while he was in his senior year at the Chain of Lakes Collegiate High School but was unable to establish it during that time.</p></div>

        <div class="camera-1867184_1280"><img src="../images_from_pixabay/other_authors'_images/camera-1867184_1280.jpg" alt="camera-1867184_1280"></div>


        <div class="p2"><p>So, during his college years, he began meeting people with creative minds who were willing to work with him on making this club. After a few years of making videos together and producing several short films including the award-winning animated short “The Rainbow Mirror,” Dominic decided it was time to take this talented team a step further.</p></div>

        <div class="p3"><p>One day, he gathered everyone in the club together and announced, “We are going to take this club into the film industry! We are going to bring new ideas to films, movies, and animation. We will start a business that will grow into a company and eventually become a leading industry example. Our first step is to start raising money, finding a place to convert into a professional studio, and gaining the equipment we’ll need. We’ll show the world that you don’t need overpriced equipment to make a good production, just overpriced ideas…”</p></div>

        <div class="p4"><p>After a few years of struggle to start the business, finishing his bachelor’s degree, and fighting several copyright claims on his productions, he finally made his company into a respectable studio. Not only for video and film production but also for photography, animation, printing, and writing.
